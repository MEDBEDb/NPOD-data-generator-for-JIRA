# NPOD-data-generator-for-JIRA
NPOD is a little python script to help generate filters in JIRA... To run the script simply enter: python npod.py n (where n - is number of issues and filters needed to be generated), it will also create 1 project by default for you. Optionally, if you have a custom jira intsance running in cloud - you could specify it as an optional param -jira yourinstance.yourdomain.com, only thing to make sure - the auth should be admin:admin for that instance. If -jira param is not specified, the script will call a default instance on http://localhost:8090/jira/"
